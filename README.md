Great thanks to Lamer87 who made [Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker) and 0x000015, that made [ColorfulRainbow](https://github.com/0x000015/ColorfulRainbow).

I felt like making my own as i can update it whenever another update hits and they gave me the insipration and knowledge to do so.
