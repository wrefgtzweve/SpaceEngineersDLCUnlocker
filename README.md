# FAQ
### Can you unlock all the DLC skins too?
- From as far as i can see no, those are managed through steam inventory and thus cannot be done.

### Can you add the latest DLC blocks?
- Yes! let me know in the issues tab and i'll gladly do so.

### Does this work for player skins?
- No, however there is a method available that makes the skins visible for yourself which can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/MCTwsfd), thanks to [gorre9090](https://github.com/gorre9090) for showing me this!



# Credits

Great thanks to Lamer87 who made [Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker) and 0x000015 that made [ColorfulRainbow](https://github.com/0x000015/ColorfulRainbow).

I felt like making my own as i can update it whenever another update hits and they gave me the insipration and knowledge to do so.
